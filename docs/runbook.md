## Investigating Dead-Lettered Jobs

### Symptoms

- Job status is `DeadLettered`
- All retry attempts exhausted (`currentAttempt` equals `maxAttempts`)

### Steps

1. **Find the job**

   ```
   GET /api/imports?status=DeadLettered
   ```

   Note the job `id`.

2. **Inspect job detail**

   ```
   GET /api/imports/{id}
   ```

   Check:
   - `lastErrorCode` — machine-readable error code
   - `lastErrorMessage` — human-readable description
   - `currentAttempt` / `maxAttempts` — confirms retries were exhausted

3. **Read the full audit history**

   ```
   GET /api/imports/{id}/history
   ```

   The history shows every status transition in chronological order, including each `ProcessingFailed → Parsing` retry cycle and the final `ProcessingFailed → DeadLettered` transition.

4. **Determine root cause**

   Use `lastErrorCode` and the audit history to identify the failure pattern:

   - Repeated `ProcessingFailed` with the same error code → likely a permanent infrastructure problem (e.g. DB schema mismatch, missing config)
   - First attempt `ValidationFailed`, then moved to dead-letter manually → data problem
   - Intermittent `ProcessingFailed` with different error codes → transient infrastructure instability

5. **Decide: requeue or discard**

   - **Requeue** if the root cause has been resolved (infrastructure was fixed, config was corrected) → see [Manual Requeue](#manual-requeue)
   - **Discard** if the file itself has unrecoverable data errors and cannot be corrected by the supplier

### Common Causes

| Cause                            | Error Category | Resolution                                                   |
|----------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| DB connection timeout            | Transient      | Check DB host availability; requeue once stable              |
| Malformed CSV / JSON             | Permanent      | Ask supplier to resend corrected file; do not requeue        |
| Missing required fields          | Permanent      | Ask supplier to resend corrected file; do not requeue        |
| Invalid date format              | Permanent      | Ask supplier to use ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`)           |
| Quantity ≤ 0                     | Permanent      | Ask supplier to correct line items; do not requeue           |
| Duplicate idempotency key        | —              | No action needed; original job is still active               |
| Worker crashed mid-processing    | Transient      | Stale lock recovered automatically; job will retry           |

---

## Investigating Stuck Jobs

### Symptoms

- Job has been in `Parsing`, `Validating`, or `Processing` for longer than expected
- New jobs remain in `Received` without transitioning
- Worker heartbeat is stale on `GET /health`

### Steps

1. **Check the worker health endpoint**

   ```
   GET /health   (Worker Host)
   ```

   A stale heartbeat means the worker process has stopped or is unresponsive. Restart the worker container.

2. **Check if the worker is running**

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   docker compose logs worker --tail=50
   ```

   Look for crash messages, unhandled exceptions, or DB connectivity errors.

3. **Identify jobs stuck in a processing state**

   ```
   GET /api/imports?status=Processing
   GET /api/imports?status=Parsing
   GET /api/imports?status=Validating
   ```

   If a job has been in one of these states beyond the expected processing window, the outbox entry for that job may have a stale lock. The worker's stale-lock recovery mechanism will reclaim it automatically after the configured timeout. If recovery does not occur, restart the worker.

4. **Check outbox entries directly (if DB access is available)**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM outbox_entries WHERE status = 'Processing' ORDER BY locked_at;
   ```

   Entries with a `locked_at` timestamp older than the stale-lock timeout are candidates for recovery.

## Manual Requeue

### When to Requeue

- Job is `DeadLettered` and the underlying infrastructure problem has been resolved
- Job is `DeadLettered` due to a transient error that is now unlikely to recur
- Job is `ValidationFailed` because a validation rule was incorrect or overly strict and has since been corrected

### When NOT to Requeue

- Job is `Succeeded` — requeue returns `409 Conflict`
- Job is currently in an active processing state (`Parsing`, `Validating`, `Processing`)
- The file itself has permanent data errors that have not been corrected — requeueing will produce the same `ValidationFailed` outcome

### Procedure

1. Confirm the job is in a requeue-able state (`DeadLettered` or `ValidationFailed`):

   ```
   GET /api/imports/{id}
   ```

2. Confirm the root cause has been resolved.

3. Submit the requeue request:

   ```
   POST /api/imports/{id}/requeue
   ```

   Expected response: `202 Accepted` with `Location: /api/imports/{id}`

4. Monitor the job status:

   ```
   GET /api/imports/{id}
   ```

   The job should transition: `Received → Parsing → Validating → Processing → Succeeded`

5. Verify by checking the audit history:

   ```
   GET /api/imports/{id}/history
   ```

   The history will show the requeue event with `triggeredBy: API` followed by the new processing cycle.

---

## Worker Not Processing Jobs

### Symptoms

- New jobs stay in `Received` indefinitely
- Outbox entries remain `Pending`

### Steps

1. **Check worker health**

   ```
   GET /health   (Worker Host)
   ```

2. **Check worker logs**

   ```bash
   docker compose logs worker --tail=100
   ```

   Look for:
   - DB connection errors (worker cannot reach PostgreSQL)
   - Unhandled exceptions in the processing loop
   - Application startup failures

3. **Verify PostgreSQL is reachable**

   ```bash
   docker compose ps db
   docker compose logs db --tail=20
   ```

4. **Restart the worker if it has crashed**

   ```bash
   docker compose restart worker
   ```

5. **Verify polling resumes**

   After restart, new `Received` jobs should transition to `Parsing` within one polling interval (default: 5 seconds).

---

## Health Check Failures

### API Host

`GET /health` returns `Unhealthy`:

- **DB check failed** — the API cannot reach PostgreSQL. Check DB container status and connection string configuration in `appsettings.json` / environment variables.
- **Partial degradation** — some checks healthy, others not. Inspect the response body for per-component status.

### Worker Host

`GET /health` returns `Unhealthy`:

- **DB check failed** — same as API; check PostgreSQL connectivity.
- **Heartbeat stale** — the worker's background loop has not updated its heartbeat within the expected window. The worker process may be deadlocked or overwhelmed. Check worker logs and restart if necessary.

---

## Log Investigation

### Finding Logs for a Specific Job

All log entries produced while processing a job are enriched with the `JobId` property. To find all logs for a specific job:

```bash
# Docker Compose — filter by JobId
docker compose logs worker | grep "<job-id>"
docker compose logs api    | grep "<job-id>"
```

In a structured log aggregator (e.g. Seq, Grafana Loki), filter by:

```
JobId = "<job-id>"
```

### Common Log Patterns

| Log message pattern                                                       | Meaning                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `Claimed outbox entry {EntryId} for job {JobId}`                          | Worker picked up a job (DB strategy)                  |
| `Pipeline succeeded for job {JobId}`                                      | All steps completed, DeliveryItems persisted          |
| `Pipeline partially succeeded for job {JobId}`                            | Batch job completed with chunk failures               |
| `Chunk {N}/{Total} failed for job {JobId}. Lines in chunk: {Count}.`      | One chunk failed (Warning); pipeline continues        |
| `Pipeline failed for job {JobId}: {ErrorCode}`                            | Permanent failure — job will not be retried           |
| `Transient failure for job {JobId}, attempt {N}`                          | Retry scheduled with exponential backoff              |
| `Job {JobId} dead-lettered after {N} attempts`                            | All retries exhausted, DeadLetterEntry created        |
| `Job {JobId} requeued`                                                    | Manual requeue accepted, new OutboxEntry created      |
| `RabbitMQ connection failed … retrying in {N}s`                           | Broker unreachable at startup; will retry             |

## RabbitMQ Connection Issues

> Applies when `Dispatch:Strategy = RabbitMQ`.

### Symptoms

- New jobs stay in `Received` indefinitely
- Worker logs show `RabbitMQ connection failed` or `BrokerUnreachableException`
- API logs show publish errors immediately after job creation

### Steps

1. **Check that RabbitMQ is running**

   ```bash
   docker compose ps rabbitmq
   docker compose logs rabbitmq --tail=30
   ```

2. **Verify broker connectivity from the worker container**

   ```bash
   docker compose exec worker curl -f http://rabbitmq:15672/api/healthchecks/node \
     -u guest:<RABBITMQ_PASSWORD>
   ```

   Expected response: `{"status":"ok"}`.

3. **Check the Management UI**

   Open `http://localhost:15672` (default credentials: `guest` / `<RABBITMQ_PASSWORD>`).

   Verify:
   - The `import-jobs` queue exists and is not in an error state
   - Connections from both the API publisher and Worker consumer are listed under **Connections**

4. **Inspect reconnect behaviour**

   The `RabbitMqConnectionManager` retries the initial connection with a configurable interval
   (default: 5 seconds). If the broker was temporarily unavailable at startup, restart the
   affected container once the broker is healthy:

   ```bash
   docker compose restart api worker
   ```

5. **Fall back to the database strategy temporarily**

   If the broker is unavailable and jobs must continue processing:

   ```bash
   docker compose stop api worker
   # Edit docker-compose.yml: set Dispatch__Strategy=Database on both services
   docker compose up -d api worker
   ```

   See [Switching dispatch strategies](#switching-dispatch-strategies).

## Queue Inspection via Management UI

Open `http://localhost:15672` and log in with the configured RabbitMQ credentials.

### Queues

Navigate to **Queues and Streams**. Key queues:

| Queue | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `import-jobs` | Main work queue; messages are published by the API and consumed by the Worker |
| `import-jobs.dead-letters` | Messages that the Worker could not process and that exceeded RabbitMQ's delivery limits |

**Metrics to watch:**

| Metric | Healthy | Action needed |
|---|---|---|
| `Ready` | Low (close to 0) | Backlog building — check Worker health |
| `Unacked` | ≤ number of active Worker threads | Messages are stuck unacknowledged — check Worker logs |
| `Total` | Matches `Ready + Unacked` | — |

### Connections and Channels

Navigate to **Connections**. Expect at least two connections:

- One from the API (producer channel for `BasicPublish`)
- One from the Worker (consumer channel for `BasicConsume`)

If either is missing, restart the corresponding service.

---

## Dead-Letter Queue Investigation (RabbitMQ)

When the Worker fails to acknowledge a message and the broker's delivery limit is reached, the
message is moved to `import-jobs.dead-letters` via the dead-letter exchange `import-jobs.dlx`.

> **Note:** RabbitMQ dead-lettering is distinct from Ingestor's application-level `DeadLettered`
> job status. A job can reach `DeadLettered` status via either strategy. Inspect both the queue
> and the API to get the full picture.

### Steps

1. **Check for messages in the dead-letter queue**

   Management UI → **Queues** → `import-jobs.dead-letters` → **Get messages**.

   Each message contains a JSON body with `jobId`, `supplierCode`, and `importType`.

2. **Cross-reference with the job API**

   ```
   GET /api/imports/{jobId}
   ```

   Check `lastErrorCode`, `lastErrorMessage`, and `currentAttempt`.

3. **Read the full audit history**

   ```
   GET /api/imports/{jobId}/history
   ```

4. **Decide: requeue or discard**

   - If the root cause (infrastructure or data) has been resolved → see [Manual Requeue](#manual-requeue)
   - If the data is unrecoverable → no action needed; the job is already in `DeadLettered` state

5. **Remove the message from the dead-letter queue**

   Once the job has been handled via the API, purge or manually remove the dead-letter queue
   message via the Management UI to keep the queue clean.

---

## Switching Dispatch Strategies

Both the API and Worker must use the same strategy at all times. A mismatch (API publishes to
RabbitMQ, Worker polls the DB) will cause jobs to queue up without being processed.

### Switch to RabbitMQ

1. Ensure RabbitMQ is healthy: `docker compose ps rabbitmq`
2. Set `Dispatch__Strategy=RabbitMQ` on both `api` and `worker` services (environment variable
   or `appsettings.json`)
3. Restart both services:

   ```bash
   docker compose restart api worker
   ```

4. Submit a test job and confirm it transitions to `Succeeded`.

### Switch to Database

1. Set `Dispatch__Strategy=Database` on both services
2. Restart both services:

   ```bash
   docker compose restart api worker
   ```

3. Any messages remaining in the RabbitMQ `import-jobs` queue will not be consumed. If jobs
   were in-flight (published to RabbitMQ but not yet consumed), their `OutboxEntry` records
   were also written to the database and will be picked up by the Worker on the next poll cycle.

### Verify the active strategy

Check the Worker startup logs:

```bash
docker compose logs worker | grep -i "dispatch"
```

Look for a line confirming which dispatcher was registered (e.g. `Using DatabaseJobDispatcher`
or `Using RabbitMqJobDispatcher`).

---

## Investigating PartiallySucceeded Jobs

### Symptoms

- Job status is `PartiallySucceeded`
- `failedLines > 0`; `processedLines + failedLines = totalLines`
- Fewer `DeliveryItems` persisted than the total line count

### What it means

The job processed a file in chunks (batch mode). At least one chunk encountered a transient
error during the database write (e.g. connection timeout). The pipeline caught the error,
recorded the chunk as failed, and continued processing the remaining chunks.

### Steps

1. **Check job detail**

   ```
   GET /api/imports/{id}
   ```

   Note `processedLines`, `failedLines`, and `chunkSize`.

2. **Read the audit history**

   ```
   GET /api/imports/{id}/history
   ```

   Look for the `Processing → PartiallySucceeded` transition and any warning messages that
   accompany chunk failures.

3. **Check Worker logs around the processing time**

   ```bash
   docker compose logs worker | grep "<job-id>"
   ```

   Chunk failures are logged at `Warning` level:
   `Chunk {N}/{Total} failed for job {JobId}. Lines in chunk: {Count}.`

4. **Decide: requeue or accept**

   - **Requeue** if the infrastructure issue was transient and has resolved. The entire file
     will be reprocessed from scratch; already-persisted `DeliveryItems` from the original run
     are **not** deduplicated, so requeuing may produce duplicate items.
   - **Accept** if the failed lines are non-critical and the successfully processed items are
     sufficient for the business operation.

## Azure Container Apps Deployment

> Applies when running `Ingestor.Web` on Azure Container Apps.

### Data Protection Keys Lost After Container Restart

**Symptoms**

- File upload button on the Imports page appears active but produces no response after a period of inactivity
- No network error visible in browser DevTools; the Blazor circuit connects successfully
- Server logs show antiforgery token validation failures

**Cause**

Azure Container Apps defaults to scale-to-zero: the container stops when there is no traffic and restarts on the next request. Each restart generates new in-memory Data Protection keys. Tokens encrypted by the previous process are invalid on restart.

**Fix**

1. Ensure a storage account and `dataprotection` container exist:

   ```bash
   az storage account create -g <rg> -n <storage-name> --location northeurope --sku Standard_LRS
   az storage container create --account-name <storage-name> --name dataprotection
   ```

2. Retrieve the connection string and store it as a Container Apps secret:

   ```bash
   az storage account show-connection-string -g <rg> -n <storage-name> --query connectionString -o tsv

   az containerapp secret set -g <rg> -n ca-ingestor-web \
     --secrets "dp-storage=<connection-string>"
   ```

3. Set the environment variable referencing the secret:

   ```bash
   az containerapp update -g <rg> -n ca-ingestor-web \
     --set-env-vars "DataProtection__StorageConnectionString=secretref:dp-storage"
   ```

4. Force a new revision so the secret takes effect:

   ```bash
   az containerapp update -g <rg> -n ca-ingestor-web --revision-suffix v2
   ```

See [ADR-019](adrs/019-data-protection-azure-blob-storage.md) for the design rationale.

---

### Scale-to-Zero Cold Start Latency

**Symptoms**

- The first request after a period of inactivity takes noticeably longer (typically 5–15 seconds)

**Cause**

This is expected behaviour. Azure Container Apps stops idle containers and restarts them on the next request. The delay is the container startup time.

No action is required unless the latency is unacceptable. To prevent scale-to-zero entirely, set `--min-replicas 1`:

```bash
az containerapp update -g <rg> -n ca-ingestor-web --min-replicas 1
```

Note: `--min-replicas 1` incurs cost even when idle.

---

### Secret Update Not Taking Effect

**Symptoms**

- A secret was updated via `az containerapp secret set` but the running container still uses the old value

**Cause**

Container Apps secrets are applied at revision creation time, not dynamically. An existing revision does not pick up secret changes.

**Fix**

Force a new revision:

```bash
az containerapp update -g <rg> -n <app-name> --revision-suffix v<N>
```

Use an incrementing suffix (v2, v3, ...) to distinguish revisions.
